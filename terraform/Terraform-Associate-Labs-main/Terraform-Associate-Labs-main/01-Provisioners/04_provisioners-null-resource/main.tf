4:Terraform, the null_resource is a special resource that doesn't manage any infrastructure directly. Instead, it is often used for tasks that don't involve provisioning actual infrastructure resources but require some additional actions, such as running scripts, executing commands, or triggering external systems. When used with a provisioner, the null_resource serves as a way to run actions that depend on other resources, like waiting for an instance to be ready or executing post-deployment tasks.

### Scenario for the Terraform Code:

**Question**:  
You are tasked with provisioning an EC2 instance in AWS for a project. The instance needs to be placed inside an existing VPC (with ID `vpc-bd9bdcc7`). It must have a security group that allows HTTP access from any source and SSH access from a specific IP (`104.194.51.113/32`). You will also provide an SSH key for access. Additionally, a file named `barsoon.txt` should be uploaded to the instance's home directory using a `file` provisioner. After the instance is created, you need to ensure that it has successfully started by waiting for its status to be "ok" before proceeding. Finally, you want to output the public IP of the EC2 instance.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Provider & Region**: This configuration specifies the AWS provider (`hashicorp/aws`) and the region (`us-east-1`) where resources will be created.
- **Security Group**: The security group allows HTTP (port 80) traffic from anywhere and SSH (port 22) traffic only from a specific IP (`104.194.51.113/32`).
- **Key Pair**: An SSH key pair is created to allow SSH access to the EC2 instance.
- **User Data**: A user data script (likely for configuring the instance on startup) is passed to the EC2 instance.
- **EC2 Instance**: The EC2 instance is created using a specified AMI, instance type, and security group. The file provisioner uploads a file (`barsoon.txt`) to the instance, and a local-exec provisioner waits for the instance to reach the "running" status.
- **Output**: The public IP address of the EC2 instance is outputted at the end.

This code automates the process of provisioning and configuring an EC2 instance with a security group, key pair, and user data, while also ensuring the instance is properly set up and accessible.
