5: the terraform_data resource type you mentioned is not an actual Terraform resource type. I assume you meant null_resource or possibly referring to local-exec provisioners for executing commands or scripts locally.
### Scenario Question:

**Scenario**: You are tasked with setting up an EC2 instance in AWS for hosting a web application. You need to:

1. **Create an EC2 instance** that is part of an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
2. **Assign a security group** to the instance that allows HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) access.
3. **Provision the instance with a custom SSH key** for secure access.
4. **Run a script during instance creation** to configure the instance using a `user_data` file.
5. **Upload a file** (`barsoon.txt`) to the EC2 instance after it is created.
6. **Wait until the EC2 instance is fully running** before marking the deployment as complete.
7. **Output the public IP address** of the EC2 instance.

**Write a Terraform script that fulfills these requirements** and explain the purpose of each line in the script.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Terraform Block**:
   - Specifies the required AWS provider version (`5.78.0`) and configures the AWS provider to interact with resources in the `us-east-1` region.

2. **Data Block for VPC**:
   - Fetches information about an existing VPC using its ID (`vpc-c3be22b9`), which will be used for the EC2 instance and security group.

3. **Security Group Resource**:
   - Defines an AWS security group (`sg_my_server`) and configures inbound (HTTP and SSH) and outbound rules for traffic. The security group is associated with the existing VPC.

4. **Key Pair Resource**:
   - Defines an AWS SSH key pair (`deployer-key`) using a public key for secure SSH access to the EC2 instance.

5. **User Data**:
   - Loads a `user_data` script from a local YAML file to configure the EC2 instance upon initialization.

6. **EC2 Instance Resource**:
   - Launches an EC2 instance (`my_server`) with a specified AMI, instance type, security group, and SSH key pair. It also provisions a file (`barsoon.txt`) onto the instance after it is created.

7. **Terraform Data Resource for Status**:
   - Uses a `local-exec` provisioner to execute the `aws ec2 wait` command to ensure that the EC2 instance is fully initialized and in "ok" status before the deployment is considered complete.

8. **Output Block**:
   - Outputs the public IP of the EC2 instance for later use or access.
