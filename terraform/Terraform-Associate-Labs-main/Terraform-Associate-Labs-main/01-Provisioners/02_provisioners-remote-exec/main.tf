2:Explanation of provisioner "remote-exec" in Terraform
The remote-exec provisioner in Terraform is used to execute commands on a remote resource (such as an EC2 instance) after it has been created. It establishes an SSH or WinRM connection to the instance and runs the specified commands, which can be helpful for tasks like software installation, configuration, or post-deployment customization.
### Scenario:
You are a cloud engineer tasked with deploying an EC2 instance in AWS for hosting a web application. The requirements are as follows:
1. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Use an existing VPC identified by its ID `vpc-bd9bdcc7`.
   - Create a security group with the following rules:
     - Allow HTTP traffic (port 80) from any IP address.
     - Allow SSH access (port 22) from a specific IP address (`104.194.51.113/32`).
     - Permit all outbound traffic.
2. **Instance Configuration**:
   - Use the `ami-087c17d1fe0178315` Amazon Linux AMI.
   - Launch the instance as a `t2.micro` type for cost efficiency.
   - Associate the instance with a newly created SSH key pair named `deployer-key`.
   - Provide a custom startup script (`userdata.yaml`) for the instance initialization.
3. **Provisioning**:
   - Log the private IP address of the instance to a local file named `private_ips.txt`.
4. **Output**:
   - Display the public IP address of the EC2 instance once the deployment is complete.
**Question**:  
How would you write a Terraform configuration file to meet these requirements, ensuring proper security and provisioning? Include all necessary resources, data blocks, and output values.

The provided Terraform code fulfills this scenario and includes comments explaining the task of each line. If you need further details, let me know!
