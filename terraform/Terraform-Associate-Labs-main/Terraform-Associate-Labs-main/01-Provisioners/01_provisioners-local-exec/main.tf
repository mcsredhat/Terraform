In Terraform, a provisioner is used to execute specific actions on a resource after it has been created or modified. Provisioners are often used to perform tasks like configuring a server or uploading files, which canâ€™t be directly handled by Terraform itself, but are needed to fully set up a resource. They help automate the setup and configuration of infrastructure once it is provisioned.
1:provisioners local-exec 
Purpose:
The local-exec provisioner allows you to perform additional configuration or logging tasks locally after the resource is created or updated.
It is typically used for tasks like logging information, invoking scripts, or interacting with other systems that are accessible from the local machine.
### Scenario:

You are tasked with deploying a secure web server in AWS using Terraform. The requirements are as follows:

1. **Networking Configuration**:
   - The server must be placed inside an existing VPC with ID `vpc-xxxxx`.
   - The server should allow HTTP traffic from anywhere.
   - SSH access must be restricted to a specific IP address (`xxxxx`).

2. **Security Configuration**:
   - The instance should only allow outbound traffic to any destination.

3. **Access Management**:
   - Create a key pair named `deployer-key` using a provided SSH public key for secure access.

4. **Instance Configuration**:
   - Use the `ami-087c17d1fe0178315` Amazon Machine Image.
   - Deploy a `t2.micro` instance.
   - Use a user data script (`userdata.yaml`) for initialization.
   - Attach the above-defined security group to the instance.

5. **Provisioning**:
   - After deployment, log the instance's private IP to a file named `private_ips.txt` on the local machine.

6. **Output**:
   - Display the public IP address of the deployed instance after Terraform completes.

**Question**:  
How would you write a Terraform configuration to fulfill the above requirements while adhering to security and networking best practices? 

Write a Terraform code block to solve this scenario.
