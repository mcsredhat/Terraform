3:The provisioners file task refers to using provisioners to automate configuration tasks, such as installing software, modifying files, or running commands on the virtual machines or other infrastructure components that Terraform manages.
### Scenario:
**Question**:  
You are tasked with deploying a secure EC2 instance in AWS with the following requirements:
- The instance must allow HTTP access for all users and SSH access restricted to a single IP.
- The instance should belong to an existing VPC identified by its ID.
- Use a specific SSH key for authentication.
- The instance must be tagged and configured using a user data script.
- Capture the private IP of the instance locally and store it in a file.
- Finally, display the public IP of the instance as an output.  

**How would you achieve this using Terraform?**

---

**Answer**: The provided Terraform code accomplishes all these requirements. Here is a line-by-line explanation:

```hcl
# Define the Terraform configuration block
terraform {  
  required_providers {  # Specify the providers required for the configuration
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"  # AWS provider source
      version = "5.78.0"  # Define the provider version
    }
  }
}

# Configure the AWS provider
provider "aws" {  
  region = "us-east-1"  # Set the region for deploying AWS resources (N. Virginia)
}

# Fetch details about an existing VPC using its ID
data "aws_vpc" "main" {  
  id = "vpc-bd9bdcc7"  # Specify the VPC ID
}

# Define a security group to control instance traffic
resource "aws_security_group" "sg_my_server" {  
  name        = "sg_my_server"  # Security group name
  description = "MyServer Security Group"  # Description of the security group
  vpc_id      = data.aws_vpc.main.id  # Link the security group to the existing VPC

  ingress = [  # Define inbound (ingress) rules
    {
      description      = "HTTP"  # Allow HTTP access
      from_port        = 80  # Start port 80
      to_port          = 80  # End port 80
      protocol         = "tcp"  # TCP protocol
      cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow traffic from all IPv4 addresses
      ipv6_cidr_blocks = []  # No IPv6 access
      prefix_list_ids  = []  # No prefix lists
      security_groups  = []  # No additional security groups
      self = false  # Deny traffic within the group itself
    },
    {
      description      = "SSH"  # Allow SSH access
      from_port        = 22  # Start port 22
      to_port          = 22  # End port 22
      protocol         = "tcp"  # TCP protocol
      cidr_blocks      = ["104.194.51.113/32"]  # Restrict to a specific IPv4 address
      ipv6_cidr_blocks = []  # No IPv6 access
      prefix_list_ids  = []  # No prefix lists
      security_groups  = []  # No additional security groups
      self = false  # Deny traffic within the group itself
    }
  ]

  egress = [  # Define outbound (egress) rules
    {
      description      = "outgoing traffic"  # Allow outgoing traffic
      from_port        = 0  # All ports
      to_port          = 0  # All ports
      protocol         = "-1"  # Allow all protocols
      cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Allow all IPv4 addresses
      ipv6_cidr_blocks = ["::/0"]  # Allow all IPv6 addresses
      prefix_list_ids  = []  # No prefix lists
      security_groups  = []  # No additional security groups
      self = false  # Deny traffic within the group itself
    }
  ]
}

# Define an SSH key pair for secure access
resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {  
  key_name   = "deployer-key"  # Key pair name
  public_key = "YOUR_SSH_KEY"  # Specify the public SSH key
}

# Use an external file for user data
data "template_file" "user_data" {  
  template = file("./userdata.yaml")  # Load the script from userdata.yaml
}

# Define an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "my_server" {  
  ami           = "ami-087c17d1fe0178315"  # AMI for the instance
  instance_type = "t2.micro"  # Use a t2.micro instance (low-cost)
  key_name      = aws_key_pair.deployer.key_name  # Associate the SSH key pair
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.sg_my_server.id]  # Attach the security group
  user_data     = data.template_file.user_data.rendered  # Pass the user data script for initialization

  # Use a provisioner to write content to the instance
  provisioner "file" {
    content     = "mars"  # Content to be written
    destination = "/home/ec2-user/barsoon.txt"  # Destination file on the instance
    connection {  
      type        = "ssh"  # Use SSH to connect
      user        = "ec2-user"  # Default user for Amazon Linux
      host        = "${self.public_ip}"  # Connect using the instance's public IP
      private_key = "${file("/root/.ssh/terraform")}"  # Specify the private key
    }
  }

  tags = {  
    Name = "MyServer"  # Tag the instance
  }
}

# Output the public IP of the instance
output "public_ip" {  
  value = aws_instance.my_server.public_ip  # Return the instance's public IP address
}
