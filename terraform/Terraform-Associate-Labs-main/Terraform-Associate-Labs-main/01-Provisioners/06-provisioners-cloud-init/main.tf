6:the Cloud-Init provisioner is a special type of provisioner that is often used with cloud instances, particularly for configuring and initializing them after they've been launched. Cloud-Init is a widely used tool in cloud environments (such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) to automate the initial configuration of cloud instances.

### Question/Scenario:

**Scenario:** You need to provision an EC2 instance in AWS with specific settings for security and SSH access. The server must be deployed within an existing VPC, and you want to ensure that the EC2 instance is properly configured with a security group, an SSH key pair, and a custom user data script. Additionally, you want to use a provisioner to upload a file to the newly created instance once it's available. After the deployment, you want to output the public IP of the instance.

Write a Terraform configuration to achieve the following:
1. Create a security group for HTTP and SSH access.
2. Create a key pair for SSH access.
3. Create an EC2 instance with the security group and SSH key pair.
4. Use a provisioner to upload a file (`barsoon.txt`) to the instance after it's created.
5. Output the public IP of the EC2 instance.

### Terraform Configuration Answer with Comments:

### Explanation of Code:
- **`provider` block:** Defines the AWS provider configuration, specifying the region (`us-east-1`).
- **`data "aws_vpc"`:** Fetches details of the VPC with a specific ID to be used by resources like security groups.
- **`aws_security_group` resource:** Creates a security group with ingress rules for HTTP and SSH access, and an egress rule allowing all outbound traffic.
- **`aws_key_pair` resource:** Defines an SSH key pair for accessing the EC2 instance.
- **`data "template_file"` resource:** Reads a `userdata.yaml` file, which can be used to provide configuration or initialization instructions for the EC2 instance.
- **`aws_instance` resource:** Defines an EC2 instance with a specified AMI, instance type, security group, key pair, and user data. A **file provisioner** is used to upload a file (`barsoon.txt`) to the EC2 instance after it is created.
- **`output` block:** Outputs the public IP address of the EC2 instance, making it available for use in subsequent Terraform runs or other automation processes.

This Terraform configuration is a full-fledged solution to provision a secure EC2 instance in AWS, upload a file, and output the instance's public IP.
